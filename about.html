        <p>Hello! My name is Han Tran. I have just completed my first year of at<br>
        Orange Coast College. I am a computer science major, and I will be graduating<br>
        from OCC with an AS degree in Mathematics in 2021. I am also a member of an<br>
		honor society called Phi Theta Kappa at OCC.<br>
        </p>

		<p>I first found my interest in coding during my junior year of high school.<br>
		My first computer science class was AP Computer Science Principles which taught<br>
		me how to build a website, create a game from scratch.io, and Python. However,<br>
		it was not until I took AP Computer Science A, from which I learned Java, that<br>
		I found my passion for coding and programming languages. Fast forward to the<br>
		presence, I have just completed my C++ class with an A+ and look forward to<br>
		taking more CS classes next semester.<br>
